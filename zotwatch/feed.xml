In particular, current prompt-based approaches often struggle to identify dominant semantic cues and fail to generalize to novel classes in RS scenarios.

Using comparable backbones, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on public KIE benchmarks, including CORD, SROIE, and DocVQA, and generalizes well without access to downstream coordinate annotations during fine-tuning. Moreover, the proposed vision grounding mechanism can be integrated into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like Qwen2-VL, improving zero-shot KIE.

Recent methods incorporate explicit coordinate outputs, yet depend on downstream coordinate annotations that are not always available in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce STNet ( &amp;quot; role=&amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt; ee then &amp;quot; role=&amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt; ell Net), an end-to-end model that jointly produces textual answers and their corresponding vision grounding. The core innovation in STNet is a novel &amp;quot; role=&amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt; token, prepended to each response, which implicitly encodes the physical coordinates. During generation, &amp;quot; role=&amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt; directs the model to first &amp;quot; role=&amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt; — attending to image regions relevant to the question — and then &amp;quot; role=&amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt; , emitting the textual answer. To enhance the model’s &amp;quot; role=&amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt; capabilities, we collect extensive structured table recognition datasets. Based on these datasets, we leverage GPT-4 to develop TVG ( &amp;quot; role=&amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt; ableQA with &amp;quot; role=&amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt; ision &amp;quot; role=&amp;quot;presentation&amp;quot;&amp;gt; rounding), a dataset of Question Answering (QA) pairs annotated with vision grounding. Using comparable backbones, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on public KIE benchmarks, including CORD, SROIE, and DocVQA, and generalizes well without access to downstream coordinate annotations during fine-tuning. Moreover, the proposed vision grounding mechanism can be integrated into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like Qwen2-VL, improving zero-shot KIE. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Learning From Videos Through Graph-to-Graphs Generative Modeling for Robotic Manipulation</title><link>https://doi.org/10.1109/tro.2026.3658211</link><guid>10.1109/tro.2026.3658211</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 20:31:39 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Guangyan Chen</dc:creator><dc:creator>Meiling Wang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Te Cui</dc:creator><dc:creator>Chengcai Yang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mengxiao Hu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Haoyang Lu</dc:creator><dc:creator>Zicai Peng</dc:creator><dc:creator>Tianxing Zhou</dc:creator><dc:creator>Xinran Jiang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yi Yang</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yufeng Yue</dc:creator><prism:publicationName>IEEE Transactions on Robotics</prism:publicationName><prism:doi>10.1109/tro.2026.3658211</prism:doi><description>Learning from demonstration is a powerful method for robotic skill acquisition.

In this work, we introduce MV-SAM, a framework for multi-view segmentation that achieves 3D consistency using pointmaps -- 3D points reconstructed from unposed images by recent visual geometry models. Leveraging the pixel-point one-to-one correspondence of pointmaps, MV-SAM lifts images and prompts into 3D space, eliminating the need for explicit 3D networks or annotated 3D data. Specifically, MV-SAM extends SAM by lifting image embeddings from its pretrained encoder into 3D point embeddings, which are decoded by a transformer using cross-attention with 3D prompt embeddings. This design aligns 2D interactions with 3D geometry, enabling the model to implicitly learn consistent masks across views through 3D positional embeddings.

However, existing object-centric perception paradigms and loosely coupled vision-language pipelines are still difficult to support management-oriented anomaly understanding required in real-world urban governance. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovLA-10K, the first management-oriented multi-modal benchmark for low-altitude intelligence, along with GovLA-Reasoner, a unified vision-language reasoning framework tailored for governance-aware aerial perception. Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM).
