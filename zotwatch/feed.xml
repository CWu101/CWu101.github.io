However, existing mainstream OVSS models are mostly trained on natural images and struggle to handle the rotational diversity and unique characteristics of RSI, resulting in insufficient feature representation and category discrimination capabilities. To ameliorate this challenge, we propose ROSS, an open vocabulary semantic segmentation framework that combines effective feature fusion with dedicated modeling of RSI characteristics. Specifically, ROSS employs a dual-branch image encoder (DBIE): one branch leverages multi-directional augmentation to enhance the representation of rotation-invariant features, while the other incorporates remote sensing (RS) specific knowledge via an encoder pretrained on large-scale RSI data. During feature fusion, ROSS generates cost maps from both branches and designs a spatial-class dual-level cost aggregation (SDCA) module based on spatial and category information, thereby fully integrating global spatial context and category discriminability. Finally, we introduce a RS knowledge transfer upsampling module that efficiently fuses and reconstructs multi-scale features to achieve high-resolution and fine-grained segmentation. Experiments on four open-vocabulary RS datasets demonstrate that ROSS consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. This robust performance across different training and evaluation configurations verifies its effectiveness and broad applicability.

However, existing MS research faces several challenges, including (1) ignoring fine-grained key information between visual and textual modalities and interaction with coarse-grained information, (2) cross-modal semantic inconsistency, which hinders alignment and fusion of visual and textual feature spaces, and (3) ignoring inherent heterogeneity of an image when filtering visual information, which causes excessive filtering or excessive retention. To address these issues, we propose Coarse-and-Fine Granularity Synergy and Region Counterfactual Reasoning Filter (CFCR) for MS. Specifically, we design Coarse-and-Fine Granularity Synergy (CFS) to capture both global (coarse-grained) and important detailed (fine-grained) information in text and image modalities. Based on this, we design Dual-granularity Contrastive Learning (DCL) for mapping coarse-grained and fine-grained visual features into the text semantic space, thereby reducing semantic inconsistency caused by modality differences at dual granularity levels, and facilitating cross-modal alignment. To address the issue of excessive filtering or excessive retention in visual information filtering, we design a Region Counterfactual Reasoning Filter (RCF) that employs Counterfactual Reasoning to determine the validity of image regions and generate category labels. These labels are then used to train Image Region Selector to select regions beneficial for summarization. Extensive experiments on the representative MMSS and MSMO dataset show that CFCR outperforms multiple strong baselines, particularly in terms of selecting and focusing on critical details, demonstrating its effectiveness in MS.

However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent and substantial improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward VO methods.

This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent and substantial improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward VO methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Cognitively-Inspired Tokens Overcome Egocentric Bias in Multimodal Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16378v1</link><guid>http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16378v1</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:21:27 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Bridget Leonard</dc:creator><dc:creator>Scott O.

Current work has successfully combined graph neural networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to improve recommendation accuracy and mitigate the inherent sparse data problem. Yet, view augmentation strategies borrowed from other domains—such as edge or node dropout—tend to distort the original graph structure, leading to unintended semantic drift and suboptimal representation learning. Moreover, prior work has predominantly focused on optimizing inter-modal weights while overlooking user-specific modality preferences and adaptation of modal features generated by generic models. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel multi-m O dal d U al a T tention G raph c O ntrastive learning framework (OUTGO). Specifically, we first encode user and item representations by utilizing user and item homogeneous GNNs. Then, we employ designed intra- and inter-attention mechanisms, sequentially and adaptively, tuning each modal feature value based on the principal loss and considering fusing them with different modal perspectives. Additionally, semantic and structural contrastive learning tasks are introduced to alleviate the sparse data without destroying the original data structure. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of OUTGO compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OUTGO .

&lt;p&gt;Multi-modal recommender systems, incorporating rich content information (e.g., images and texts) into user behavior modeling, have attracted significant attention recently. Current work has successfully combined graph neural networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to improve recommendation accuracy and mitigate the inherent sparse data problem.

We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps. Our findings reveal object-driven shortcuts as a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR and demonstrate that addressing them is essential for robust compositional video understanding.
